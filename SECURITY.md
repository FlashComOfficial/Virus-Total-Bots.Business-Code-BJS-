## 🔑 Security Notes for Users
- **API Keys:** Never share or hardcode your VirusTotal API key in public repositories. Always keep it private.  
- **Data Privacy:** Files submitted to VirusTotal are stored, analyzed, and may be shared with security partners.  
  - ⚠️ **Do not upload sensitive or private files**.  
- **Usage Risks:**  
  - Results are **powered by VirusTotal engines** and may not be 100% accurate.  
  - The bot only reports results — it does **not prevent, clean, or block malware**.  
- **Extensions & Input:** If you modify supported file extensions, ensure they are properly validated to avoid abuse.
